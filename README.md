## Description
This project is currently in development. The application would run the [CheckMate Test Automation Framework](https://github.com/DaniSestan/CheckMate) on a web server and would be fully accessible online, as opposed to the original framework which is stored locally and launched by your OS. The application also includes a database repository of test reports.
The application provides a simple UI that asks for user input to be used in generating scripts and data sets that will automate tests run on web applications. No coding or scripting of any kind is required to create and execute tests. All of this takes place in the background. Users can create an account to store, access, and modify all tests, data, and reports.

## Built With:
This project is designed as full-stack application, built with the following tools.
* **Java Development Kit 8** : provides the libraries, JVM, and other components to run the app, along with tools for compiling and debugging
* **Spring** : Java based framework used for the backend REST API
    * **Spring Boot 2**
    * **Spring Web** 
    * **Spring Data**
    * **Spring Initializer**
* **Gradle** : Dependency management
* **MongoDB** : Document database – used by the back-end application to store its data as JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) documents
* **Express** : Back-end web application framework running on top of Node.js
* **React** : Front-end web app framework; runs the JavaScript code in the user's browser, allowing the application UI to be dynamic
* **Node.js** : JavaScript runtime environment – allows the application back-end to be implemented in JavaScript

The application will be deployed on an Ubuntu AWS EC2 instance.

The framework integrates Java and Selenium. Selenium provides the playback tool for authoring functional tests without the need to learn a test scripting language.

The application is being designed to provide user functionality, addressing three main aspects:
* Representing users in the database
* User authentication (and accounts)
* Access control

Test sets, data sets, and reporting generated by the framework are stored and accessible to users through the application. With persistent storage, users' data can be stored to an account, allowing them to access modify run their data for future test runs. This includes run configurations for test sets, individual scripts, test data, as well as custom keywords. The UI will allow users to easily search for and filter through data stored to their account. 

## Features:
* **Reusability:** the framwork is set apart by its ability to implement and maximize reusability. Scripts can be modified and allowed to run from any point in the test. This is particularly useful when troubleshooting failpoints. This is done by preserving the session data from the browser while running each test. The driver can then step "back in time", essentially starting from any point in a prior test instance, using the recorded session data. Tests are also modularized, allowing for scripts to be broken down into components which can reused in other test scripts where they are referenced.
* **Keyword-Driven Testing:** with keywords, no coding is required to write test scripts. Testers can add and customize keywords that symbolize the functionalities used in testing.
* **Data-Driven Testing:** allows users to easily create and manipulate large data sets and to test large volumes of data quickly.
* **Reporting:** the framework automatically generates reports and screenshots of the tests, and prints the results to an html file in an easy-to-read format. Reports provide details about each test step, including specifics about where, when, and how the step was executed and what test data was used.
* **Cross Browser/Platform:** Compatible with Windows and Linux and supports all major browsers.
* **Environments:** Build your tests once and run them against multiple environments or using different sets of test data.
